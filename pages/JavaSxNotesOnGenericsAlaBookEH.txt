!!Invoking and Instantiating a Generic Type
* the T in Box<T> is a type parameter and the Integer in Box<Integer> is a type argument.
{{{
    class Box<T> {}
}}}
* To reference the generic Box class from within your code, you must perform a generic type invocation, which replaces T with some concrete value, such as Integer:
{{{
Box<Integer> integerBox;
}}}
* Since now we only have values of one type, we can safely get elements without a cast:
{{{
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
String s = list.get(0);
}}}
/%
%%tab-extends
!!extends generics 
* You can subtype a generic class or interface by extending or implementing it. The relationship between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements clauses.
* Using the Collections classes as an example, ArrayList<E> implements List<E>, and List<E> extends Collection<E>. So ArrayList<String> is a subtype of List<String>, which is a subtype of Collection<String>. So long as you do not vary the type argument, the subtyping relationship is preserved between the types.
* Now imagine we want to define our own list interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element. Its declaration might look like:
{{{
interface PayloadList<E,P> extends List<E> {
  void setPayload(int index, P val);
  ...
}
}}}
* The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List<String>:
{{{
PayloadList<String,String>
PayloadList<String,Integer>
PayloadList<String,Exception>
}}}
{{{
void processStringList(List<String> stringList) {
    // process stringList
}
processStringList(Collections.emptyList());
}}}

%%tab-multiple
!!Multiple Bounds

The preceding example illustrates the use of a type parameter with a single bound, but a type parameter can have multiple bounds:
{{{
<T extends B1 & B2 & B3>
}}}
A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. If one of the bounds is a class, it must be specified first. For example:
{{{
Class A { /* ... */ }
interface B { /* ... */ }
interface C { /* ... */ }

class D <T extends A & B & C> { /* ... */ }
}}}
If bound A is not specified first, you get a compile-time error:
{{{
class D <T extends B & A & C> { /* ... */ }  // compile-time error
}}}

%%tab-DiamondOperator
!!<> diamond operator

Java 8, type inference was improved:
{{{
void testGenericParam(List<String> list) { }
void test() {
	 // In Java 7, this line generates a compile error
	 // In Java 8, this line compiles fine
	testGenericParam(new ArrayList<>());
}
}}}

%%tab-Classes
!! Generic Classes
* the generic type T will be available anywhere within the class:
{{{
class Holder<T> {
    private T t;
    public Holder(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }
    public T getObject() {
        return t;
    }
    public void printObject() {
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
}}}

* when an instance is created, we just specify the type of T for that instance:
{{{

Holder<String> h1 = new Holder<>("Hi");
Holder<Integer> h2 = new Holder<>(1);
String s = h1.getObject();
}}}
* If we don't specify a type parameter, we will be using the raw type (that uses the Object type):
{{{
Holder h3 = new Holder("Hi again");
Object o = h3.getObject();
}}}

/%
%%tab-Method
!! Generic Methods
* these define method that takes an argument of type <T> and then a method of type <T,U>
* When a method declares its own generic type, it has to be specified before the return type (in contrast to classes, which declare it after the class name).
{{{
<T> void genericMethod1(List<T> list) { }
<T, U> T genericMethod2(U u) {
    T t = null;
    return t;
}
}}}
Now consider the following method:
{{{
public void boxTest(Box<Number> n) { /* ... */ }
}}}
* What type of argument does it accept? By looking at its signature, you can see that it accepts a single argument whose type is Box<Number>. But what does that mean? Are you allowed to pass in Box<Integer> or Box<Double>, as you might expect? The answer is "no", because Box<Integer> and Box<Double> are not subtypes of Box<Number>.

!!! examples
* don't get confused, one thing is what can you assign and another thing is what you can add, for example:
{{{
List<Integer> listInteger = new ArrayList<>();
List<Object> listObject = new ArrayList<>();
List<? super Number> listSuperNum = new ArrayList<>();
listSuperNum.add(new Integer(1)); // OK
listSuperNum.add(new Float(1.0F)); // OK
listSuperNum = listInteger; // Error!
listSuperNum = listObject; // OK
}}}

%%tab-unbounded
!!! unbounded 
* unbounded wildcard type {{{<?>}}} means that the type of the list is unknown so that it can match ANY type.
* you can consider in a way {{{List<?>}}} as the superclass of all Lists, since you can assign any type of List.
* when using the unbounded wildcard the assignment becomes IMMUTABLE.

%%tab-bounded
!!! bounded wildcards
{{{
class Printer<T> {
   public void print(T t) {
      System.out.println(t.toUpperCase());// Error
      // What if T doesn't represent a String?
   }
}
}}}

* The solution is to use the so-called bounded wildcards:
{{{
? extends T (Upper-bounded wildcard)
? super T (Lower-bounded wildcard)
}}}

%%tab-typeInference
!! Type Inference
* The type has been explicitly provided, <Integer,String>.
{{{
boolean same = Util.<Integer, String>compare(p1, p2);
}}}
* type inference: allows you to invoke a generic method as an ordinary method, without specifying a type between angle brackets.
{{{boolean same = Util.compare(p1, p2);}}}

%%tab-TypeErasure
!! Type Erasure
It's important to emphasize that generics are a thing of the compiler.
At runtime, Java doesn't know about generics.
Under the hood, the compiler inserts all the checks and casts for you,
but at runtime, a generic type is seen by Java as a java.lang.Object
type. The process of replacing all references to generic types with Object is
called type erasure.
{{{
List raw = new ArrayList();	 // Raw type because not declaring the generic
}}}
/%
%%tab-limitations
!! Limitations
* no primative types
* no "new" instances of the generic type. including arrays and lists
* no static fields of the generic type
* no "instanceof" binding on a generic type // because of erasure 
* You cannot instantiate an array of generic types (e.g. {{{ T[] foo = new T[100] ;}}})
* no generic types and exceptions: 
{{{
    class Test<T extends Exception> {
        public void method() throws T { } ; // OK
        public void method2() throws Test<T extends Exception> { } ; // error
        public void method3() throws Test<T> { } ; // error
    }
}}}
* You cannot overload a method where type erasure will leave the parameters with the same type.
{{{
HUH? List<String>[] array2 = .... HUH? 
}}}

%%tab-RawType
!! Raw Type
Raw types show up in legacy code because lots of API classes (such as the Collections classes) were not generic prior to JDK 5.0. When using raw types, you essentially get pre-generics behavior â€” a Box gives you Objects. For backward compatibility, assigning a parameterized type to its raw type is allowed:
{{{
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box rawBox = stringBox;               // OK

// But if you assign a raw type to a parameterized type, you get a warning:

Box rawBox = new Box();           // rawBox is a raw type of Box<T>
Box<Integer> intBox = rawBox;     // warning: unchecked conversion
}}}
The @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation suppresses unchecked warnings.
