* Install.jsp process failed. Need to place custom properties file in WEB-INF/classes 

I had to add a custom jspwiki properties file named WEB-INF/classes/jspwiki-custom.properties. the Install.jsp process failed to pick up my config changes. moreover,  [jspwiki guidance|https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Documentation#section-Documentation-SectionDocumentationConfigurationAndAdministration] about placing the custom properties in WEB-INF/lib has no effect. I had to place it in WEB-INF/classes and restart the context.
